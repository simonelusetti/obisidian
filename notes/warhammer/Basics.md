## 🎨 Miniature Painting Basics

🧪 Paint Consistency

 **Thick Paint**
- Paint **straight from the pot** (too concentrated).
- Has **too much pigment and binder**, not enough water.
- Dries quickly and leaves **visible brush marks**.
- **Covers fast**, but:
    - Fills in small details.
    - Makes the model look rough or “blobby”

**Use:**
- Rarely. Only for **drybrushing** or **textured effects**

 **Thin Paint**
- Paint **mixed with a bit of water or medium**.
- Flows smoothly off the brush.
- Preserves fine details and sculpted texture.
- May need **2–3 coats** for solid color

**Use:**
- Always for **basecoating**, **layering**, and **highlighting**

**Good consistency test:**
- Flows like **whole milk** (not too runny, not thick).
- When you drag it on your palette, it should make a smooth, even stroke without clumps

💧 How to Thin Paints
1. **Put a small drop of paint** on your palette.
2. **Dip your brush in water**, then touch the brush to the edge of the paint.
3. **Mix** until it looks smooth and spreads easily.
4. **Test:**
    - If it covers evenly but doesn’t obscure detail → ✅ good.
    - If it runs or pools → too thin.
    - If it feels sticky or leaves ridges → too thick

🪵 Palettes
 **Dry Palette**
- Any flat surface:
    - Plastic lid, foil, old tile, small plate.
- Used to **mix and thin paints**.
- Paint **dries fast** (10–15 minutes).
- Simple and perfect for beginners

 **Wet Palette**
- Keeps paint **moist and workable** for hours or days.
- Great for longer sessions or smooth blending
- How it works:
	- Container + damp sponge or paper towel + baking parchment on top.
	- Water slowly rises through the paper, keeping paint hydrated.
- Benefits
	- Paint stays smooth.
	- Easier to mix and re-use colors.
	- Saves paint and time.

# ⚙️ Simple 5-Step Painting Workflow

🪶 **Step 1: Prime the Model**

**Purpose:** Give the paint something to stick to and define light/dark areas.  
**How:**
- Shake your primer well
- Spray in **short bursts**, about **20–30 cm (8–12 in)** away
- Rotate the model so all angles are covered
- Let it dry for **at least 20 minutes** before painting

**Tips:**
- **Black primer** = easier shading, hides mistakes
- **White or grey primer** = brighter colors, better for lighter schemes

 🎨 **Step 2: Basecoat (Main Colors)**

**Purpose:** Lay down solid, even colors  
**How:**
- Put a little paint on your palette
- Add a _tiny bit_ of water (so it flows like milk)
- Apply in **2 thin coats** instead of one thick one

**Example:**
- Armor → dark blue/red/green
- Skin → flesh tone or green    
- Metal → silver or gunmetal

Let each coat dry before adding another

 💧 **Step 3: Wash / Shade**

**Purpose:** Add depth and shadows fast.  
**How:**
- Use a pre-made **wash** (like _Nuln Oil_, _Agrax Earthshade_, or similar)
- Load your brush and **let it flow into the recesses**
- If it pools too much, clean your brush and wick away the excess

When it dries, you’ll instantly see more definition — it’s like magic. ✨

 🌟 **Step 4: Simple Highlight or Drybrush**

**Purpose:** Bring out edges and texture

**Option A – Drybrush (easiest)**
- Take a big old brush
- Dab it in a lighter version of your base color
- Wipe most paint off on a paper towel
- Lightly sweep across raised edges and surfaces

**Option B – Edge Highlight (a bit neater)**
- Use a fine brush
- Pick a lighter color
- Paint just the **edges** and **raised lines**

Either way, this step adds contrast and pop

 🎯 **Step 5: Details & Finishing Touches**

**Purpose:** Make the mini look complete.  
**Ideas:**
- Paint eyes or lenses (a dot of white or bright color)
- Add metallic touches (weapon edges, armor trim)
- Paint the base (brown for dirt, grey for rock)

Optional: After everything’s dry, you can spray or brush on a **matte varnish** to protect your work
## 🧠 Mindset Tips
- Don’t chase perfection — aim for **clean, simple color and clear contrast.**
- Paint one or two models first before tackling a whole squad.
