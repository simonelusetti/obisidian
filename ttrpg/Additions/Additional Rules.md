In this document more niche rules, which while widely used, are not fundamental to understand the game's ideas and philosophy. As such we suggest to ready this only when after you get comfortable with the game's core rules
# Tokens

Tokens are used to represent simple, temporary changes to a character. Whenever a Scene ends, all tokens you have are removed. After applying its effects, a Token is Expended and removed from the character carrying it. You can have a maximum of 2 of each Tokens at time. Following is the list of the current tokens

- **Lucky:** after you do a Roll, but before any effect of its result are triggered, you may roll all Dice again and ignore the first Roll
- **Armor:** ignore the next instance of Damage you would take
- **Power:** your next instance of Damage deals twice its normal amount
- **Weak:** the next instance of Damage you deal is halved
- **Vulnerable:** the next instance of Damage you take is doubled
- **Taunt:** when choosing characters to Attack, a character must attack characters with Taunt Tokens if possible
- **Stealth:** you cannot be target while you have a Stealth Token, however dealing Damage will remove this Token

Modifiers:
- **Persistent:** a Persistent Token is not lost when the Scene changes, but only on Rest
- **Ephemeral:** an Ephemeral Token only last until the start of the next turn of the character controlling the effect that created it 
- **Countless:** a character can have any amount of Countless Token (instead of just 2)
# Extras

Extras are characters that do not have their own character sheet, instead using simplified rules. They are always under the control of some other character: think of skeletons being raised by a necromancer or a peasant militia levied by a charismatic player. This is called the Controller. If they die or suffer a Major Subjugation any Extras they control also go away, be it the skeletons falling back into lifeless bones or the peasants fleeing the battlefield

Extras as considered their own character with their own WP, but have the same Personalities as their Controller and follow a few rules specific for them. They can't use SE to get BD on their own, though they may still gain them from other character's effects. In Clashes, they do not Activate any SE, instead they have a score called Power, which determines the amount of BD they gain when Attacking or Defending

Note: they may still gain control of Clash Props

**Masses:** Some Extras aren't a single being but a multitude, a swarm of stinging insects, an army of zombies, and so on. These are called Masses. Their Power is always equal to their WP, so as they get Damaged or Healed they shrink and grow in strength

Additionally, they count as being as many characters as their WP. Taking any Damage from an effect that can damage multiple characters halves their WP instead of dealing the normal amount. Similarly, any Healing effect that can Heal more than one character doubles their WP, however this cannot bring them over their original WP
