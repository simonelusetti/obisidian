This document contains Items that are, for one reason or another, strange. They are mostly Mythics with the **Binding** rule, meaning that upon collection they *must* be used by their owner, drastically changing their playstyle

Peculiar Items may be rare and exotic artifacts, forbidden curses or the result of weird altercations with supernatural forces. Whatever their origin they are intended 
1. For more advanced players
2. To be collected during an established adventure, as a reward or punishment, by a player the Director believes has earned them (for better or worse)
As such, while the Director and players are the masters of their story and can choose to ignore this rule, we kindly advice to not let the players gain these Items when completing any milestone, but as a result of a focused and narratively connected storyline

**The Thirst (Mythic) (Binding)** (1)
*It's use unthinkable, it's acquirement unforgivable, it's absence unberable*

**The Hunger (Mythic) (Binding)** (1)
*When ideology and weapons will fail you, your muscles and sinew will not*
