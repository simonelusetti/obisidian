In this document and explanation of Items, how to use them, and the list of the game's core Items
# Items

There is no real concept of classes in this game, instead Items are used to represent mechanically unique effects. A character can carry as many items as they wish regardless of reasonability. Especially since, while called Items, they must not be physical objects but maybe skills, abilities or certain properties

There are however Mythical Items: particularly powerful ones that define how your character playstyle. You can think of these as your "class". When you create a new character you start with a Mythical Item. While you can, ATDD, get a new one Mythical Item, you can only ever Hold one

There are three states Items can be in relation to you:
- Owned: this means you own the Item, but may not have it on you, such as keeping it in your base
- Carried: this means that, while you physically have the Item on you, for some reason it's not active: imagine a sword in its sheat
- Held: like Carried, but this is the only state in which you actually gain the effects of the Items. Note, obviously, that an Held Item is also Carried

The Director can decide when to let players gain additional Items, and whether to give them specific ones or let them choose for themselves. It is advised to give a character a new Item every time they complete an important milestone, just like with Traits. Gaining new Items and Items of higher Activation Cost (which will be harder to use effectively in a Clash) will naturally increase the agency of a character.

**Abilities and Cost:** As described in the Clash section, Items can have an Activation Cost. This is indicated by the number next to their name. 

They may also have abilities that require you to pay a cost to activate them. These are called Activated Abilities and have three components:
- (word in parenthesis) indicate a Rapid Ability. Unless differently specified you may only use an Activated Ability during your turn and only when no other effect is on the Stack (see Advanced Rules). Some however can be used at specific times, indicated by the words in parenthesis. If there's an R which stands for Reaction, you need to expend your Reaction to do so. As a reminder: you have one Reaction each turn (not just yours). Sometimes, parenthesis are also used to indicate the number of uses 
- {words in brackets} are the Cost, which is usually just a Number, the amount of Value you need to pay (reminder: most SE have a Value of 1). Exs, which stands for Exhaust, is also common, representing that you need to Exhaust the Item to activate it. Some have more specific costs that are fully described in the item. 
- The effect: that comes after the column. This is simply the effect of the Ability

You cannot Exs an Item the *turn it entered*, neither to pay for Costs or to use one of its Abilities that requires it

The two other kind of Abilities Items have are Passive Abilities, which are always active, and Triggered Abilities, which are easy to spot since they mention a situation in which they automatically activate. These are the ones that use "if, when, whenever" and so on

**Narrative Form:** It defines what an Item actually looks like in the narrative. Since there are no rules for weight, space, one/two handling and so on, what an Item is represented by in the narrative can be freely chosen, ATTD. For example the previously mentioned Thunder Hammer may actually be a hammer that occasionally shoots sparks in a classic fantasy setting. In a more sci-fi scenario it may be represented as a malfunctioning power weapon. It may not even be an actual Item: if you want to roleplay as a barbarian who strikes people by channelling lightning in her fists it may just be a sort of natural ability your character has without being a physical object. While free to be molded, every Item possesses at least a suggested Narrative Form

While there’s no strict class system, we have chosen to order the most common items in a way that resembles the most popular classes. You are in no way limited to follow these “build paths”, but feel free to rely on them during your first adventures
## Wizard

*The Wizard is a character that focuses on spells: learning, casting and building up on them. It's the perfect class for people who like to express their creativity with unique casting effects*

**Tome of the Eternal Student (Mythic)** (2)
*I swear the extra arm was completely intentional. Goes with my third eye*
- Spell slots: 4 3 2
- Inherent spells: [TODO]
- Narrative Form: [TODO]
- *Watch and Learn* 
	- whenever you witness first hand the use of a Spell you can try to learn it for yourself. To do so spend 1 Hour during a Rest or 2 Hours if your last experience with it was more than 7 Rests ago 
	- You can also transcribe a spell you only have second hand experience with, like reading it from a book, being in a place with visible effects of its cast, hearing witnesses talk about and so on. Doing so takes meaningful time, 2 Hours during a Rest, and it's not guaranteed to work: make a Roll against the original caster of the Spell, on a fail the attempt to learn it is fruitless. If the second hand experience is particularly high quality (such as an intact lore book or hearing about it from a powerful caster), you can use them as Props for 1 or 2 BD during this Roll
	- Note: learning a spell this won’t necessarily tell everything about the Spell. You may only learn it's Name, Level or Symbol instead of all of them. However, whenever you cast it during a Clash you learn one of these missing information (chosen at random)

**Misspelling Hat** (3)
*Fire Bolt seemed to have no effect, until the wizard realized he now had to find another job*

	- Level: the maximum of Levels from the expended Spell Slots
	- Symbol: any from at least one Spell you know
- This ability can only be used outside of Clashes

**Disenchanting Ring** (3)

- *Purge Spell -* {Exs, 1}: target a Spell Trait of creature in the Scene and make a Check against the original caster of the Spell Trait. If you win, the Spell ends

	- *Overload -* if the Spell Hits and is not Persistent, it deals Damage equal to its Potential Damage. If it Hits and is Persistent the amount of BD/MD the target gains is doubled and so is the number of them that can be spent with it in each Check
	- *Overcharge -* the Spell Hits automatically

*The barbarian is many things, but the main one is focused. This is a character for players who want to go all in on something and ignore the distractions.

Unwilling characters can make a Roll to resist this effect, but if they fail and later in the same Scene suffer a Subjugation. If this brings them over the maximum, you choose which one they lose. This ability cannot be used on characters already under its effect

You can perform the single Roll to narrate how you stole an important item from a character a few years ago, and so on. The Flashback can only go so far as since your last Rest (included).
