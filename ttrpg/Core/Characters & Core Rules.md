In this document the main rules of the game, which we advice to be read by every player at least once. This isn't intended as a "core book" with supplements to follow, but instead a showcase of this game's ideas. As such, other useful, but a bit more niche, rules are not included
# Core Mechanics

**ATDD:** *At The Director's Discretion*. You will see this acronym used a lot. This game heavily relies on the concepts that are arguably "lines in the sand". Some rules refer to actions that are "meaningfully to the narrative", "major characters" and so on. How meaningful? When does a character becomes a "major one". Most of these decisions depend so much on the particular kind of narrative and game you want to play that only the Director can make an informed call. As such, despite our best effort to regulate and schematize the rules as much as possible (after all, these are what rules are for), the Director will become judge and have to interpret the rules

**Scene:** *The fundamental unit of role playing time and space*. A Scene is a prima example of something that is extremely hard to define axiomatically, but is easy to spot "when you see it". Scenes are how this game spells time and space: most effects last a Scene, or can be used only once per Scene, and so on

>**Designer's Note:** It's always ATDD when a Scene changes to another, however there a few guidelines:
>- A meaningful amount of time has passed, or the location changed
>- A major character entered or left the location
>- The short term conflict has shifted, the current problem was solved or it got worse

> **Designer's Note:** we advise everyone to read our Designer's Notes, however these are mostly geared towards Directors (or aspiring) and people interested in our more in depth thoughts on how to use a rule. If you are just skimming this document to get a hang of the game feel free to skip them

**Rolls**: *The chief mechanic of this game. Whenever a character wants to perform an action with an undetermined narrative result they must make a Roll*

Rolls are always done by a character (the Attacker) against another character (the Defender), even when done against inanimate objects or the environment: the Defender for that roll is the character governing these obstacles

**Example:** *You are trying to pick a lock, that lock uses the Personalities of the character who put it in place*

Note: it’s not uncommon for important (tho inanimate) objects or locations to have a character sheet, to represent how their importance personifies them. An example could be a Vampire's castle having its own character sheet separate from its master's

Rolls are almost always made with and against a Symbol (see below for symbols), the first being the one used by the Attacker the second the Defender's

>**Designer's Note:** Rolls are reserved for actions that *tense, unpredictable and lead to interesting situations both on success and on failure*. There's no need for Rolls for mundane actions such as simply unsheathing a sword, and crucially neither for actions that are simply beyond the character's abilities. "I Roll to see if I can seduce the dragon" shouldn't be a thing. Both of these are obviously ATDD: if they feel that a checking if a character can correctly unsheat their sword without cutting a finger would lead to an interesting gameplay moment, they have all the right to do so. Similarly, if they feel like giving a slim slim chance of seducing an ancient and tyranical dragon to the players, they can. Although both of these extremes become boring quickly, don't abuse them

If you makes Roll, regardless of success, you will *never* make the same Roll again. Rolls aren't momentaneous: they aren't asking "does my character manages to climb this wall?", they are asking "is my character *able* to climb this wall?". Once a Roll is resolved it permanently changes the narrative: from now in perpetuity, your character will be able or unable to climb that wall. 

>**Designer's Note:** It's ATDD what "the same Roll" entails. If you fail and your character is unable to climb that wall, it's perfectly fine to try again when you have trained, prepared or otherwise changed as a character 

To do a Roll you roll 1d20, the Base Die. The required number to pass the roll is defined by:
$$
11 - \text{your Attacking Personality} + \text{the Defender’s Defending Personality}
$$
(See below for Personalities)

This number is called the Difficulty. Some effects can add Bonus Dice or Malus Dice to a Roll. If you have any Bonus Dice on this Roll you roll an additional 1d20 for each and keep the highest one. If you instead have any Malus Dice you roll an additional 1d20 for each and keep the lowest. If you have a combination of both they cancel out. A few examples:
- With 3 BD and 3 MD you roll normally (just the Base Die)
- With 3 BD and 2 MD you roll 2d20 (the base and the resulting bonus) and keep the highest
- With 5 MD and 3 BD you roll 3d20 and keep the lowest
A Natural Result of 20 is always a Success and 1 is always a Failure, where Natural Success means the actual result of the Base Die 

Rolling multiple 1s in a roll is a Disaster, rolling multiple 20s is a Breakthrough, together they are called Criticals. Disasters are always failures and Breakthroughs are always successes. The Director is encouraged to narrate especially outstanding, surprising or simply funny narrative results when a Critical. On top of that they can often trigger additional effects

>**Note:** For Rolls where you roll a very high number of dice, it’s not uncommon to have both multiple 1s and multiple 20s, in which case the Roll is considered a Breakthrough if you had more BD than MD, or a Disaster otherwise. If you had neither, by default is a Breakthrough

When you roll multiple dice for a Roll, every die that is at or above the Difficulty is a Success. Normally, only one Success is necessary to pass a Roll and having multiple ones has no further effect, however some rules do care about the number of Success Dice.

>**Designer's Notes (Roll Consequences):** Since Rolls represent only tense and unpredictable actions, the world should always react to you failing one: 
>- *You fail to pick the lock on this door, unfortunately the sound of snapping metal alerts some guards*
>- *You fail to guess wether this Nobleman is lying to you, he gets suspicious and leaves*
>These are a few examples. The Director is heavily encouraged to never reduce a failed Roll to "You just fail the task and nothing happens"

**Conflict Rolls:** *The young mage stares at the cursed tome, brimming with forbidden antediluvian sorceries. Her hands move on its own*. Your character will eventually be tempted in some ways: appealing to their greed, lust, or even sense of duty and justice, their thirst for skills or knowledge. To resist these temptations you will need to pass a Conflict Roll, their Difficulty is calculated differently:
$$
6 + \text{your Tempted Personality} + \text{the Attackers’s Attacking Personality}
$$
This to represent how a character's own personality can be used against them

Most often, these Rolls are made by specific effects, and most often to resist an Alterations to your Symbols, but ATTD you can also cause Conflict Rolls when you do that appeals to the Defender’s Core Symbols. Since Conflict Rolls are (usually) harder to pass than normal Rolls for characters that have a particularly high Personality

**Example:** *Your character is tracking the Succubus through the sewers. With her back against a wall she tries to seduce your character to escape* the Director narrates, using the Succubus' Devilish Charm, which causes a Lips over Lips Conflict Roll. The Succubus' Lips is 5, with your 1 the Difficulty becomes 12, perfectly manageable. However, your bard's comrade, having Lips of 5 herself needs to pass an harsh 16 of Difficulty to resist
  
**Example:** *The captain of the guards enters the criminal's hideout and sees you, covered in blood and with some corpses behind you. He unsheats his sword and stand guard*. You might simply lie and tell him the corpses where there when you arrived, which would result in a standard Lips over Lantern Roll. However, knowing how the captain has regretfully bent the law sometimes for justice sake's you are honest: *We tracked these criminals down and killed them*. The Director might reward this action with a Conflict roll of Lantern over Lantern. Considering the captain has Lantern 7 that's not a bad proposition
# Character Sheet, Personalities, Symbols & Traits

**Personalities:** *You made numbers, values that define how you think, look and act*. The Personalities of a character are series of numbers, each called a Personality, that describe your character's physical and psychological characteristics, equivalent to Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom and so on in other games. Each Personality is a number ranging from -10 to 10. Since they are the main impact on how easily your character passes a Roll, and so what they can reliably do in the narrative, they define your character's prowess in their respective areas  

When you create your character the total sum of your Personalities must be equal to 10 but none can be higher than 6 or lower than -3

**Symbols:** Each personality is further subdivided into two Symbols each. If a Personality is the raw strength of your character in one area, a Symbol is how they are using it. When you create your character choose a Symbol from your highest and your lowest Personality, they become your Core Symbols

The Personalities and their Symbols are:
- **Precision**: precision represent talents, how skillful your character is, how calculated their movements are, how sharp their guile and intellect
	- **Lantern**: intellectual talent, investigation and deduction, the mind talent
	- **Clock**: hand eye coordination, dexterity and control over your movements
- **Passion**: how powerful the fire inside you is, your reflexes, your connections with emotions, the arts
	- **Edge**: quick thinking, aggressiveness, the ability to exert your will onto others
	- **Lips**: your charm, the seductiveness of your words and movements, your pathos
- **Determination**: your will, your ability to resist and be headstrong, your courage and fury
	- **Thunder**: how loud you can be, the brute force behind your blows, power incarnate
	- **Heart**: your ability to keep going, to maintain your state and body, your physical body
- **Depth**: that which lurks below the surface, deception, subterfuge, your connection to the invisible
	- **Star**: your connection to things and beings larger than yourself, the unseen, the insane
	- **Thorn**: scheming, poisoning, corruption and the ability to twist fate
- **Oddity**: how outside the box you are, your strangeness, lateral thinking, your ability to surprise
	- **Key**: freedom of movement and mind, how impossible to keep still you are
	- **Chaos**: unpredictable, indecipherable, the ability to thrive in chaos

**Alterations:** *Your hearts accelerates, sweat drips from your brows. All your thoughts are clouded by the need for self preservation*

Effects can cause your character to have parts of their personality or physical body altered. They might be blinded, scared, enraged. All these effects are represented by Alterations, which act on Symbols. They are:
- **Eclipsed:** This part of your personality is heavily suppressed. For example an effect that completely impairs your thinking, such as a heavy confusion spell, might Eclipse Lantern. You can never actively make actions that would lead you to make a Roll with an Eclipsed Symbol. You count as having -10 in this Symbol (note: -10, not 10 minus the actual value)
- **Obscured:** When a Symbol is Obscured, you count has having 10 less than your actual value in it
- **Stable:** The normal state of a Symbol, no changes
- **Bright:** When a Symbol is Bright add 10 to it 
- **Exalted:** When a Symbol is Exalted you count as having 10 in it. Every other Symbol is Obscured
If you would gain an Alteration while suffering from another one, the old one disappears

You are encouraged to roleplay your character Alterations. If an enfeebling effect Eclipses your Heart, narrate how your character’s movements are fatigued and slow. If your Lantern gets Exalted you can tell the group of your character is sure of seeing hidden patterns, hearing strange revelations in the wind and so on

**Traits:** traits are codified marks of your identity. ATDD they can truly be anything, but common ones include your race, your background, ties to a person or faction, knowledge in a field or expertise with a set of tools and so on. They are divided into: Major and Minor, with the difference being how core to your character's identity they are. When you make your character you start with 1 Major Trait and 2 Minor Traits
  
While there is no concept of leveling in this game, when the Director believes you have completed an important milestone, just like you would with leveling in other games, you gain two Minor Trait or a Major one. Work with them to decide which Trait to gain, as you can use this to represent how your character’s personality and skill set is changing. Every time you would gain a Trait you can also choose to swap out one Trait that you feel like has lost meaning to your character, replacing it with another of the same type (Major/Minor), in addition to gaining the new one. 
# Scene Elements & Improvisation

*One question someone might still ask from the last chapter is "what do I do with my Traits"? In this chapter we'll see how they can help with Rolls and what other elements of a Scene can (coincidentally, what a Scene Element is)*

**Props:** A prop is anything inside the narrative which (at least currently) has no mechanical representation. For example, if the Director describes a festival as having a large whicker man, that is a Prop. A grumpy, drunk, old man shouting? That is a Prop. Note that to be a Prop, something doesn't need to be a physical thing, or even a single thing, just be an element conceptually or according to the narrative. A bad weather can be a Prop, the time of day, and so on. Obviously, being a Prop or not is ATDD. Props can't, however, be things which already have rules to represent them, such as a Trait or an Item

**Scene Elements:** A Scene Element is a catchall term for everything involved in a Scene: Traits, Props and Items. Sometimes shortened to SE or NISE for Non-Item-Scene-Elements. Why have a name for them? 

**Improvisation:** 
*The cultist realizes you're following him in the market and bolts towards you, what do you do?*
First, **I yell fire to get the bazaar crowd*** \[Prop\] *running as a diversion. I bash my **Colossus Hammer*** \[Item\] *onto a post to simulate the roar of an explosion . Then, considering I'm a **pathological gambler*** \[Trait\] *I probably run from creditors a lot in my life I should be good at running*

Good use of narrative elements should be rewarded, and Improvisation is how it's done in this game. Whenever you make a Roll, you can describe up to one Prop, one Trait and one Item that you intend to exploit to help you, and how you plan to do so. If your use of these SE is interesting, evocative, or simply funny enough, ATDD they can give you some BD for this Roll:
- Items always give 1 BD
- Traits give 1 BD for Minor Traits, 2 for Major ones
- Props can give either 1 or 2 BD, depending on how interesting the Director believes you used these narrative elements
Outside of Clashes, if you use a Trait or an Item like this, you cannot use them again the same Scene. Props however can be used for Improvisation *only once*

>**Designer's Note:** The one time use of Props meant to avoid uninteresting and excessive use of them. It's perfectly fine if a player realizes they can use an element of the narrative to their own advantage, what's unreasonable is to also ask the Director to have to either make up a way for it eventually run out, or even to understand if this could be a problem in the future
>
>**Example:** A player likes to gamble in the taverns the party visits thought their adventures. One time they say *I bluff this hand, but to show how serious I am make a small cut on my tongue with my knife*. This is an interesting (though maybe cliche-ey) idea and the Director gives 1 BD for the use of this Prop. The next day, at the next tavern, the player does the same. And again in the next, and so on. In this situation the Director has two options:
>- Make a stupid reason for why would't work again on the spot
>- Realize their mistake, and whenever a player proposes for a similar Improvisation, deny it on the ground that it could be used everywhere
>To avoid this problem, the *same exact* Prop can't be used more than once, ever. Note that it's ATDD what counts as being "the same Prop" (or even a Prop at all). Meaning that if the player changed from a simple cut on the tongue, to something more elaborate like eating a rat's head, cutting off one of their fingers, or such, they could very reasonably earn the BD 

Note: when talking about using Items for Improvisation, we mean their Name and Narrative Form, since these are the only two things they posses that exist inside the narrative. Their effects are not considered, so even if an Item's abilities clash a lot from the use you wanna make of them to Improvise, you can always do so as long as its Name and Narrative Form are appropriate

Scene Elements can similarly give you MDs in the same amount they would give you BD, if their presence would hinder your action. The Director can only propose such Malus Dice but they apply only if you accept. However, when you Roll with MDs earned this way, regardless of the outcome, you gain 1 Persistent Lucky Token 

**Help & Group Rolls:** It’s not uncommon for certain actions to be taken as a group *The whole party tries to interpret some writings in an ancient ruin, to sneak past enemies, or deducing another character’s intentions*. To do so only one character does the Roll, but they earn 1 BD for each character that is *narratively eligible* to help them and 1 MD for each that would meaningfully hinder the attempt. As with any Rolls, the actions that caused them cannot be taken again in the same Scene, meaning that if 3 people try to break a door open cannot try 3 different Rolls. 

>**Designer's Note:** While this might sound harsh, functionally only allowing one character to do the Roll for the entire party has its advantages. First, this avoids penalizing smaller parties who would have less overall attempts. Secondly, it removes the ever present dilemma of "my character is ultra sneaky, but unless I go alone someone in the party gets us spotted", allowing every player to carry the rest of the party on their back if necessaries. But also, this gives every character the chance to shine. If only one person can make the Roll for everyone, then everyone (assuming a well rounded series of obstacles) will get a chance to be in the spotlight 
  
**Dodging:** 
*As the arrow hits you, you feel an exotic poison fill your veins, the archer makes a Thorn over Heart Roll to see if you suffer its effects*
*No! I slash open the wound and try to exsanguinate myself until the toxin is gone!*

When your character is Defending in a Roll, you can narrate how your character tries to react in a risky but unexpected way, taking control and swapping the Attacker and Defender’s role and changing the Symbols. For example, receiving a blow to the head would normally not even cause you to Roll, the assailant just Rolls their Thunder over your Heart. However, you can narrate how your character would try to masterfully dodge the strike instead of tanking it. It's always ATDD if to allow a Dodge, and even if allowed they are risky maneuvers that carry a price: if you fail a Dodge you take 1 additional Damage

You can attempt up to 1 Dodge per Scene
# Clashes

Clashes are an abstraction and generalization of combat and every other drawn-out conflict. Physical fights where some characters are trying to outright kill other characters are Clashes, but so are debates, stealth infiltration, manipulations and chase sequences. 

Clashes are fought in turn orders. To determine the order of turns there's no initiative roll, instead the Director decides which side starts based on the narrative situation: the side that exploded the conflict into actions always starts. From then on the Director (interpreting NPCs) and the party alternates, choosing at will which members go in which order until one side has fully played, at which point the rest of the other side plays with their remaining members. 

**Example:** If a party of 5 PCs gets attacked by 3 bandits, the Director will go first as they were the ones initiating the Clash. Then a player will have their turn. Then another bandit, then another player, then the last bandit, and lastly it will be the turn of the renaming 2 players. If party order isn’t particularly important, it’s common practice to start with the player directly to the right of the Director and go in counterclockwise order. 

Note: some powerful enemies will have more than 1 turn,  for example if a monster has 3 turns, and the party starts, the order will be player -> monster -> player -> monster -> player -> monster -> remaining players (despite the monster being a single character)

There are two types of Clashes, Major and Minor ones, representing low stakes conflicts and full on struggles. Generally, Minor Clashes are simple back and forth interactions, usually not involving physical attacks. Deceiving an unsuspicious guard, sneaking around a not so attentive thug, searching for an item with a small time pressure, these are common examples of Minor Clashes. Major Clashes usually involve fighting for your or another character’s life, but even a simple arguments with significant narrative stakes can be a Major Clash

>**Designers' Note:** This game is many things, but a simulation of reality isn’t one of them. There’s no real concept of space in Clashes, no weapon ranges, ammunition or cover. However, there are rules that abstract away these concept: the Flying effect (for example) means you can only be attacked by characters that has Flying or Range. But having Flying won’t give you a Flying speed, tell you how you move in space, rules for takeoff and landing. In general, in this game the rules never touch the narrative world directly, interacting only with other rules

Let's start with a general outline a turn in a Clash and what you can do in it:
- Breath Step: the moment when your character regains its focus, the following happen in this order
	- Your Exhausted SE unExhaust
	- Every character regains their Reaction
	- You regain your Action
	- You can Activate a Scene Element
- Main Step: the main part of the turn where you can do the following in any order
	- Narrative Actions
	- Actions
- End Step: the end of the turn, until end of turn effects stop at the end of this step

## The Breath Step

The Breath Step, as the name implies, is the first step in your turn and is when you "take a breather"

First you unExhaust all your Scene Elements, allowing them to be used again (see the Attack section). Every character gains back their Reaction, then you gain your Action and finally you have the chance to Activate a Scene Element. In most cases the order of these steps is irrelevant, but it's important to know actual timing. The only real decision is which Scene Element to Activate

While outside of a Clash, your character has all time they need to call upon their knowledge, skills, tools and creativity to solve a situation. This is not the case inside a Clash, where time to gather your resources is needed. You start with all your Traits and Items Inactive, which you can picture as you keeping them in your hand. Then, once during each Breath Step you can Activate one, only then you can use them to Attack, Study, Improvise Rolls, use their abilities and so on 

Some Scene Elements require you to be particularly focused and engaged in the Clash to activate: these have an Activation Focus Cost which you must be able to pay to Activate them. Conversely, some SE have a Focus Value. If the total Focus Value of your Activated Items is equal or higher than the Activation Focus Cost of an Item, you may Activate it

SE with no special rules have a Focus Value of 1. Noteworthy is that this is the case of Traits, meaning that even in the direst situations where you cannot gain any Focus Value from the Props in the Clash you will always at least manage to get a Focus Value equal to the Traits you carry yourself (given enough turns obviously)

Some specific SE, mainly Items, can also have abilities that require Focus Value to use, usually indicated by a number in the costs to activate such as {2}. To pay for these you must actually Exhaust SE for a combined Value equal or greater to the cost. Excess Value provided is kept until your next turn. See the Item section for more 
## Narrative Actions

During your turn in a Clash you are free to do as many actions that do not interact with the rules AND would not require a Roll as you want. These are called Narrative Actions and include minor tasks that are not too mentally or mechanically challenging: 
- moving a small distance in the game world
- dropping or picking up an object that isn't a Prop or Item
- monologuing, joking, talking Non-Tactically to other characters (see below for what Non-Tactically means) 
You can use Narrative Actions to "dress up" how your character spends the turn for dramatic, comedic or simply narrative effect. You can do as many Narrative Actions a turn you want, just be mindful of everyone's time and try to keep the Clash tense and dynamic

However, being free, Narrative Actions can't be used to do anything that interacts with the rules: you cannot use a Prop you gained in a Narrative Action (this is a specific Action called Controlling, see below), you cannot gain any bonus or advantage, not even disadvantages actually. Simply put: if it touches the rules or mechanics in any way, it cannot be a Narrative Action

Note that Narrative Actions do not use the Stack and so may be done at any moment during one's turn
## Actions

Actions are the main part of a Clash and represent efforts that take time and energy to execute, that meaningfully push you towards victory, or at least try to. Note that Action refers to two different things: 
- your Action is a resource you automatically gain during your Breath Step
- Actions are what we just described, and how you Spend your Action. Each Action costs you one Action 

These are the Main Actions, Actions every character has access to:
- Attacking another character
- Studying a character or Clash Prop
- Controlling a Clash Prop
- Making a generic Roll

**Attacking:** Attacking the actual application of your skills to defeat your opponent. It may represent a physical attack, but can also stand in for getting deeper into a mansion unseen or getting under someone’s skin while trying to seduce them

Attacks are Rolls, and like any Rolls they follow a narrative move, you are free to present this move however you like. Do you simply swing your hammer at the troll or try more subterfuge strategies like trying to trip them? To get past the guards do you move slowly and carefully or blitz it and hope they don't notice you? Just like any Roll, the way you present your actions will determine which Symbol will be used over which other Symbol

>**Important Note:** To count as an Attack, what you describe must meaningfully push you towards your goal in that Clash. This is to say that trying to talk to an faceless robotic-guard, seducing a dragon while trying to bargain with them, or hitting a guard in the face while sneaking about may, ATDD, not count as Attacks. They will influence the narrative of course, but mind you that not being actual Attacks they will not deal Damage and not work with other rules for Attacks. How to rule general Rolls is described below. In general, each Clash will still have an "obvious" way to deal with it which you can default to: hitting people, sneaking about, just lying at face value

Every rule that applies during Rolls applies during Attacks. You can use any Scene Element you have activated to aid you in the Attack, but doing so Exhausts them (you can represent this by turning the physical card sideways). They unExhaust during the Breath Step. If you succeed on the Attack's Roll you will deal your Base Damage, which by Default is 1

The main reason you might not wanna use a Scene Element while Attacking is that you can use them during an opponent’s turn when they Attack you. If you Exhaust a Scene Element while Defending this way, every BD you would get is transformed into a MD for them. This can be especially useful if you know a particularly dangerous Attack is coming: making the enemy Miss might be more effective than increasing your own chances to Hit during your turn

**Studying:** Studying represents trying to find out something about a particular character or even situation. While not as common as an Action as Attacking, Studying can really make a difference during a Clash, and at times even beyond this singular encounter

To Study you do everything you would while Attacking: choose a target, briefly describe how you try and study them, Exhaust SE, the Defender Exhaust theirs, and then you Roll. However, unlike Attacking you can target individual Scene Elements as well as characters when Studying. 

On a success you won't deal any Damage but you learn a Secret about the target. Secrets held by Scene Elements are usually just hidden effects waiting to be revealed, while those held by characters tend to be narrative only. If the target has no Secret left you will also learn that

You can specify what you're trying to learn giving clues and hints you have gathered to earn up to 2 BD in the Study's Roll. This is called Investigating and has a few extra rules. Some Secrets can only be learnt by Investigating them, using the generic Study will result in you (wrongly) learning the target has no Secrets left. However, if you Investigate a target and they have no Secrets that match the Investigation you won't learn anything (note: you will know that this action failed because of this instead of learning they have no Secrets)

**Controlling a Clash Props:** *I swing on the chandelier to kick that guy in the teeth. I'd like to stand still on the empty armor stand to sneak unnoticed by that guard*

Clash Props (CPs) are Scene Elements, specifically Props, which are inherent to a single Clash location. Like normal Props, you can use them for Focus Value or to get BD during Attacks. However to do so you must Control them. Controlling a CP represent being in an advantageous position regarding it: being on top of a defensive wall, or holding onto an hostage. 

By default, a CP that is Uncontrolled can be Controlled as an Action, which may require a Roll as gaining their control is never a secure thing. Each CP has a numer called Capacity, which determines how many characters can Control it at the same time. If you need to make a Roll to get Control of a CP while other allied characters are Controlling it, you get 1 BD for it

Note: This Roll is usually done against the creator of CP. Recall that in this game *every* Roll is done against another character. 

If you instead try to Control a CP Controlled by an enemy character, the Roll you make may be done against it instead. You do whichever has the highest Difficulty. On a success you also gain Control of the CP, and if this makes the Prop go over its Capacity you can Push Off that enemy Character, which stops Controlling it. While Controlling a CP you can also try to Push Off characters by using the Controlling a Clash Prop Action again, which again usually results in you Rolling against them 

Once Controlled, CPs work like any other Prop. Additionally, while they can perfectly just be narrative pieces with no additional rules, most have special effects that may change how to get Control of them, what happens if you are Pushed Off, specific bonuses to Control them. All of which you may not know until you interact with it or until you Study them

**Making Generic a Roll:** while the other Actions cover basically you can or might even want to do in a Clash, there are still situations and absurd things that could step outside these rulings. All of them fall under Generic Rolls

This Action represents your character trying to de-escalate a fight, or conversely trying to punch someone mid discussion or fully just deciding to flee. These are all behaviors that, done outside a Clash would require a Roll since their success is far from certain, but again are not encompassed by the other Actions

For these Rolls all rules that normally apply both to Rolls and to Clashes apply, mainly the fact that you can only use your Active Items to Improvise

## Timing Rules

By default, your Actions are Slow, meaning they can only be used during the main step of your own turn. By contrast, there are some effects that are Rapid, meaning they can be used whenever you want. Most of them will expend your Reaction, which is a resource similar to the Action which you gain at the start of each character's turn

**Priority and the Stack:** there will be a lot of situations where the exact timing of effects might seem ambiguous

Item 1 gives your Attacks 1 bonus Damage, then Item 2 doubles your Attacks Damages, how much bonus damage are you getting? Or consider the situation where two different players want to react to the same Action done by another player. To time these effects we use the Stack and Priority

Whenever an effect is being activated or an action taken, in turn order each players gains Priority, meaning they have a chance to use any Rapid effect they have access to. If one does, the same process is repeated restarting from them. In order, these effects are placed into the Stack. If at any point the Priority goes back to the player that last used a Rapid effect the Stack starts to empty, and, it being a stack, the last used effects are applied first

**Triggers Priority:** triggered abilities, AKA effects that automatically activate, also follow Priority and the Stack. If the same event triggers multiple triggered abilities they are placed on the Stack in turn order, if a player controls multiple of them they choose the order. Triggered abilities are placed on the Stack before any Rapid effect used on the same event that triggered them

**Unreactable Abilities:** some abilities are so fast they don't give anyone the chance to react. These effects do not give Priority to any other player and must be resolved before any Rapid effect can be used. Note: triggered abilities still trigger 

>**Designer's note, or an important note on role vs playing and how to marry this bickering lot:** Clashes are obviously a part of the story, in fact they should and usually are their highest points. Every game has to decide where it wants to lie in the spectrum between narrative first and gameplay first. Do design it in a way where the players have basically free reign for the purpose of writing an interesting narrative? Or you do enforce stricter rules so that the gameplay itself is fun and real tension can be felt?

>We want both sides to shine and Clashes are a way of encapsulating all the mechanical "crunch" that can be so so fun in a box where it should touch the narrative only in the begging and its end. While Clashes can be used to represent everything, the idea is for them to use the same rules, have the same crescendo and interesting decisions wether the players are killing a dragon or trying to bring it to their side (the objective might even go back and forth between them mid Clash)
>
>This is all to say that while the rules are always an abstraction of the narrative, in a Clash this abstraction should straight up become a wargame. Clashes are moments where we stop looking at the puppets to just have fun pulling strings, while we keep them in our minds. Try to not think too much about why Exhausting a broadsword can help you infiltrate a castle. Why using your "Elven Lineage" is giving a BD to resist being tricked, and so on. Why are my "Thieve's Tools" able to steal away a character's ability to use telepathy type of situations

>You can, even should when convenient, try insert the use of Scene Elements and their abilities into the narrative, but do not fret if they do not make any sense. Outside of Clashes, the narrative is King and drives the show, inside them it makes total sense for your Colossus Hammer to help you in stealth infiltration. They are ways to decide who the winner of a tense back and forth confrontation is, not what drives it or what the results will be

# WP & Damage

In this game there are no Health/Hit Points, instead there have Will Points, which function similarly but instead of representing just your physical health encompass your general willpower. A particularly nasty insult, a clever callout of a hidden scheme, and in general any action that causes significant stress on a character reduce their WP. Player characters start with 5 WP each. Doing anything severe enough to cause a character to loose even 1 WP is usually enough to instigate a Clash, but not always. Clashes are in fact the main way to completely deplete a character’s WP, at which point they are neither dead nor fainted (see Subjugations) 

Every character has two types of WP, Major and Minor, representing how much of their will they can dedicate to low states conflicts and how much to full on struggles. Minor WP are a subset of Major WP. By default, a PC has 5 Major WP, of which 2 are Minor WP. If you deal damage to a character while they are at 0 WP (Minor or Major depending on the Clash) you Win it. For example, let’s say you want to convince a guard that you are a traveling doctor here to cure the king (who you actually want to kill) of a disease. The guard is obviously suspicious so you need to convince him. He has 4 Major WP, of which 2 are Minor WP. Since this is, in the eyes of the guard, not a life or death situation, the resulting Clash is a Minor Clash. You manage to deal damage to him 3 times, winning the Minor Clash. If however you end up wanting to actually kill him, you initiate a Major Clash, which the guard will start at 2 WP (note how the last damage that won the Minor Clash doesn’t get carried over to Major ones)
  
Particularly important characters, lords and ladies, vampires, crime bosses and so on might also have some of their WP listed as Preparation WP. Essentially, it means that you can, with some clever work, damage these WP before the Clash starts, or even interacting with them at all. For example, let’s say a Noblewoman invites you over for dinner, and during it some of the party sneaks around her mansion to discover some hidden artifacts, map out the place, or simply discover letters from a secret lover. Since all of these actions give a narrative edge against her, doing so immediately damages some or all of her Preparation WP. It’s ATDD how much your preparation has dealt damage this way, and eve if you can reasonably know that value. This adds a way to incorporate prep time, investigation, manipulation and surprise effects into actual, mechanical damage. By default, each Preparation Damage is healed at the rate of 1 per Rest

As a player, your interest in winning a Clash might change. If you think a Minor Clash is very important to win, when you receive damage while at 0 Minor WP, you can decide to lose one Major WP instead. Alternatively, you can always choose to Surrender, immediately losing the Clash but without losing any WP. Anyway it ends, you regain all your Minor WP at the end of every Clash

Some effects (Spells for example) will increase your Potential Damage for a single Attack or more. Having Potential Damage X for an Attack means that you will deal 1 Damage for each Success Die in the Attack, up to X, instead of the normal total of 1 

Any Roll may be the start of a Clash, and passing the Roll will deal Damage. When a character starts a Clash this way, the defending character is considered Surprised until their next turn in the Clash, and the triggering Roll gets 1 BD. If this happens, the Defending characters are Surprised

# Subjugations

When a character loses a Clash they are Subjugated by the character(s) that have won, representing how the winners now have power over the losers. Losing Minor Clashes puts a character in Minor Subjugation and losing a Major Clash has them in Major Subjugation 

When a character is Subjugated they can’t perform any actions that would result in a Roll that would have fit the clash that caused the subjugation. This complicated sentence simply means that a Subjugated character can’t “reopen” the conflict that caused the Clash. 

**Example:** Your party is disguising as the local circus to infiltrate an hostile town. You manage to convince a real performer of this by means of winning a Minor Clash, they are now in the Minor Subjugation of *Convinced you are fellow entertainers*. They can’t suddenly start to doubt you again, as this would result in a Roll that would have fit the previous Clash. 
Let’s say your party gets physically overpowered by a monster, resulting in a Major Subjugation. You now can’t suddenly strike back against the monster while it drags you away in its den (unless you want to risk your life, see below). You can however, try to lure it away from you with food, try to reason or bargain it if it’s sentient and so on, as all these actions will cause Rolls that do not fit the original Clash (the physical fight) that started the Subjugation.

Subjugations can be ended narratively by doing something that simply changes the situation too much for the Subjugation to survive. In the example above, if a character he trusts were to accuse you of being spies, or if he were to witness your actions directly, this might (ATTD) end the Subjugation

You can also end a Major Subjugation ends automatically if a character regains any Major WP. Since Resting recovers all your Major WP all your Major Subjugations will end. Outside of this, effects that recover WP will end Subjugations. 

Note that it’s entirely based on the circumstances of the Subjugation whether or not the Subjugated character is aware of it and can try to purposefully take actions to end it. If you Subjugate a character by trickery or deception, for example, the Subjugated character won’t know about it. This often happens with Minor Subjugations. Since PCs are characters like any other, if your character gets Subjugated by a PC or NPC to be tricked into doing something, like freeing them from a curse, the Director can force you to do it, regardless of how suspicious of them you are as a player. Despite this, the Director is encouraged to not take too much control of your character away from you. 

Any character can, however, still resist while being under a Subjugation they are aware about, this includes supernatural effects that mind control them. Doing so however causes a Death Roll immediately after performing the action. Taking damage while at 0 Major WP from a Subjugating character also does so

**Death Rolls:** They represent extremely dangerous situations in which failure means the death of a character. Death Rolls are most often called when taking damage by a Subjugating character while at 0 Major WP, but can be issued when your character finds themselves at mortal peril in the narrative. 

>**Designer's Note:** If an action the player wants to do will cause a Death Roll, directly or down the line, the Director has to inform the player of such a possibility. For example, if your character is trying to escape a capture by jumping off a tall building, the Director has to tell you that it will cause a Death Roll. 
>However, even putting yourself in situations that might force you into a Death Roll later should also be explicitly called out by the Director: if your character is sneaking around a powerful wizard’s tower, and they see her, you may get the idea of trying to stab her in the back. While failing this action will obviously not immediately call a Death Roll, it will probably lead to her fighting and (most probably) disintegrating you, causing a Death Roll. In this instance the Director should say how this action might cause a Death Roll. It’s ATDD how early to warn you of such deathly dangers.

While narrative Death Rolls are decided by the nature of the action, like in the jumping from a building example, those caused by taking damage at 0 WP from a Subjugating character are done by repeating the Roll with the Symbols swapped. For example, if a bandit puts you at 0 Major Major WP and then strikes you with a dagger, they would roll Sword over Hearth, if they succeed, then you roll Heart over Sword as a Death Roll. In any case, when doing a Death Roll the Difficulty is always 10

**Resting:** Whenever the Scene changes,all characters recover all their Minor WP. Whenever the characters spend meaningful time in low intensity activities, where they don’t do any Rolls, this time is considered a Rest and recovers all of the player Resource. This includes Minor and Major WP. It’s ATDD how much in world time is required for a Rest, as the specifics depend heavily on the story. The players are encouraged to still narrate what they are doing during their Rests, usually involving Scenes that can be quickly narrated without any stakes. Shopping, repairing items, general errands are great Scenes to leave for Rests. 

There are two Hours in a Rest, which absolutely don't need to reflect actual in game hours. Some rules will requires you to spend 1 or 2 of them doing something to get a result, or they may increase or decrease the Hours you have in a Rest, and so on
# Spells

Spells in this game Spells aren’t given by your Class, since they do not exist. Instead they are given by Items. Items like fantasy grimoires, futuristic dataslates and other collections of informations usually contain a multitude of Spells to choose from. Some will have special rules to determine how many and which Spells you can cast, but most of them use Spell Slots, which are a finite Resource stored in the Item. When you cast a Spells with Spell Slots, you must expend a Spell Slot of Level equal or higher than the Spell’s own Level

A Spell (usually) has only 3 elements: the Name, the Level and the Symbol. Some Spells have special rules about their casting, but all of them do not have a specific effect on the narrative. Instead, when you cast a Spell *you* choose whichever narrative effect you desire, with some constraints. This effect is unsurprisingly called the Effect

The Effect must have a narrative connection with the Name of the spell. For example, the evergreen spell Fireball can be used with effects such as “I want to distract these enemies”, “I want to melt this metal door down” or the simple “I want this enemy fried”. However, it can’t be used with the effect “I want to resurrect this character” as the effect has no bearing with the Name. It’s ATDD to decide when the effect is appropriate with the Name. 

When you cast a Spell, you will almost always trigger a Roll, be it an impulse of arcane energy to kill a creature, an enchantment to hypnotize someone and so on. When you do so, you automatically gain a number of BD equal to the Spell’s Level, plus an additional one if the Symbol you are using is the same as Spell’s Symbol. If this Roll is an Attack during a Clash, you increase your Potential Damage to the number of BD gained with it, so usually the Spell’s Level (optionally +1 if you’re using the same Symbol).

**Example:** If you cast the spell “Neversound”, a Level 2 Key Spell, with the effect of *I emit no sound to sneakily get past that enemy*, you gain 2 BD, +1 for being a Key Roll (plus or minus BD or MD gained from other rules). You would Roll your Key over the guard’s Lantern. Let’s say the resulting Difficulty is 16 and you Roll 4, 18, 15, 16, so you succeed and easily get past. If the guard is particularly skillful, the Director may decide that a simple Roll isn’t enough and to get past him you would require a Minor Clash. In this case you carry over your Roll as an Attack, gaining a Potential Power of 3 and (with your 18 and 16 Success Dice) you deal 2 Damage. 

**Persistent Spells:** If the Spell Effect you narrate has continuous repercussions, instead of activating and going away, the Spell gives the target a special Trait. These Traits are called Spell Traits, they count as Minor Traits but do not count towards your max Traits limit. Additionally, they have a Level, which is the same as Spell’s Level. You choose the Trait you give the target but it must be consistent with the narrated Effect. The target then stores a number of BD or MD equal to twice Spell’s Level: the Spell Dice Pool

When the target makes a Roll using the Spell Trait, instead of gaining just 1 BD or MD you can expend a number of Dice from the Spell Dice Pool lower than Spell’s Level, to give them the ame amount of MD or BD. If the Roll has the same Symbol as the Spell they Roll 1 additional BD or MD, but this additional die can only be gained twice per Spell cast. When the pool is empty, the Spell’s Effect ends. When the Spell’s Effect ends, the target loses the Spell Trait and empties the Spell Dice Pool. A character can store multiple pools, but each caster may only have one Persistent Spell active at time

If used as BD in an Attack during a Clash, the ones gained from a Persistent Spell do not increase Potential Damage.

You can only have one Persistent Spell active at time, and when you do you are Concentrating. When Concentrating, if you take damage in any way you must remove one die from the Spell Dice Pool on your current Target. Resting removes any pool you have and breaks Concentration. You can also end Concentration at will, costing nothing if its your turn or your Reaction otherwise

By default, a target is aware if you casted a Persistent Spell on them, however, they normally have only a vague idea of the effects. Expert spellcasters might understand its intricacies better, especially if they saw or heard you cast the spell

**Example:** Casting the Level 1 Lips Spell Breathtaking Performance on yourself with the effect of suddenly, I want to become a master dancer, will store 2 BD, as the Spell’s Level is 1. When, later or immediately after, you have to make a Roll to determine if you can charm a group of folks at a festival, you can decide to add 1 of the BD, gaining another since this is a Lips over Lips Roll

# Skills

Skills allow you to codify your characters unique abilities, a catchall way to design ad hoc effects. You have three Skills, one Major and two Minors. Minor Skills can be used five times between them each Rest, while the Major Skill only twice. They work exactly like Spells, except that you choose both the Name and the Symbol when creating the character, and have fixed Levels. The Minor Skills are of level 1, while the Major of Level 3. You have 3 Skill Slots of Level 1 and 1 of Level 3, which function exactly like Spell Slots but are expended to use Skills.

Skills can be used to give more mechanical weight to important pieces of your character’s lore and personality. Classes, or more directly Items, give you the mechanical effects of the most common RPG classes, such as a paladin’s smite. You can use Skills to expand on that idea, but also as a way to highlight peculiarities in character

**Example:** If you decide to make a paladin-esque character, you might choose Oath’s Courage as a Level 1 Hearth Skill, which you can use to buff you up during a particularly tough combat. As a Level 3 Thunder Skill, choosing Divine Smite to be your big burst of damage is always a nice choice. If however you envision your paladin to be more of a leader among people, then Divine Splendor as a Level 3 Lantern Skill can be just as interesting to use
